# Introduction

Welcome to our Form Root specification! The Form Root serves as a foundational structure for creating various instances of forms tailored to specific needs. By utilizing this format, you can streamline the process of generating customized forms for different purposes, whether it's for surveys, registrations, feedback collection, or any other data gathering needs.

## Features:

1. **Modular Design**: The form root template is designed with modularity in mind, allowing you to easily combine forms 

2. **Customizable Fields**: You have the flexibility to customize each field to capture specific types of data. Whether it's text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, coordinates, barcode, time and date, files... this template accommodates a wide range of data types.

3. **Validation**: Built-in validation ensures that the data entered into the form meets the required criteria. You can set validation rules for mandatory fields, data formats, character limits, and more, helping to maintain data integrity and accuracy.

4. **Adaptative Layout**: By using Form mask and style, the form root is designed to be adaptative regarding different application context. Form masking enables you module the Form root content for how data is entered into specific fields. With styling options, you can customize the visual appearance of your forms to align with the user interface requirements of your application context.
